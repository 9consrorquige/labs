Salahuddin Ayubi was born in 1137 or 1138 in Tikrit, Iraq. He belonged to the Kurdish clan of Banu Ayyub, which had migrated from Armenia to northern Iraq. His father, Najm al-Din Ayyub, was a military commander who served under the Zengid dynasty of Syria and Iraq. His uncle, Asad al-Din Shirkuh, was also a prominent general who played a key role in the politics of Egypt and Syria.
 
Salahuddin Ayubi began his military career as a soldier in his uncle's Egyptian campaign. In 1169, he became vizier of Egypt's Fatimid caliphate, which was abolished two years later. Salahuddin Ayubi then embarked on a journey to unite under him all the Muslim territories in Syria, northern Mesopotamia, Palestine, and Egypt. He faced many challenges and enemies, such as the Crusaders, the Byzantines, the Assassins, and the rival Muslim states of Aleppo, Mosul, and Damascus.
 
Salahuddin Ayubi is best known for his decisive victory over the Crusaders at the Battle of Hattin in 1187, which resulted in the capture of most of the Crusader states in Palestine and Syria. He also recaptured Jerusalem from the Crusaders after a siege of 12 days. He showed great generosity and mercy to his Christian foes, allowing them to leave the city peacefully or ransom themselves. He also respected the holy sites of all religions and allowed pilgrims to visit them freely.
  
Salahuddin Ayubi continued his struggle against the Crusaders until his death in 1193. He faced a formidable opponent in Richard I, the king of England, who led the Third Crusade to reclaim Jerusalem. Although Richard won several battles against Salahuddin Ayubi, he could not recapture the holy city. After lengthy negotiations, the two leaders agreed to a truce in 1192, which allowed the Crusaders to keep a coastal strip of land and granted Christian pilgrims access to Jerusalem.
 
Salahuddin Ayubi died of a fever on March 4, 1193, in his beloved gardens in Damascus. Though relatively young (just 55 or 56), he was exhausted from a life spent in near-continuous military campaigns. He was buried in the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus, where his tomb still stands today. He had given away his great wealth to his poor subjects, leaving nothing to pay for his funeral. He was mourned by Muslims and Christians alike, who admired his courage, generosity, and piety.
 
Salahuddin Ayubi left behind a lasting legacy as one of the greatest Muslim heroes of all time. He founded the Ayyubid dynasty, which ruled over Egypt and Syria until the 13th century. He also inspired generations of Muslims to defend their lands and faith against foreign invaders. He is widely regarded as a model of chivalry and justice in both Islamic and Western cultures. He has been immortalized in literature, art, and film as a symbol of resistance and liberation.
