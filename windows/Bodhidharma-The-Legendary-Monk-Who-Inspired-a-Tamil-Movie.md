The movie, released in 2011, stars Suriya as Bodhidharma and Shruti Haasan as his love interest. The movie alternates between two timelines: one in ancient India and China, where Bodhidharma travels to spread Buddhism and teaches martial arts to the Shaolin monks; and another in modern-day Chennai, where a descendant of Bodhidharma, Aravind (also played by Suriya), tries to stop a biological warfare plot by a Chinese villain, Dong Lee (played by Johnny Nguyen).
 
The movie was directed by A.R. Murugadoss and produced by Udhayanidhi Stalin. The music was composed by Harris Jayaraj. The movie was a commercial success, grossing over â¹100 crore at the box office. It was also dubbed into Telugu and Hindi as 7th Sense and Chennai vs China respectively.

Whether you watch 7 Aum Arivu or Ezham Arivu, you will surely enjoy learning more about Bodhidharma, the legendary monk who inspired a Tamil movie.
  
Bodhidharma is not only a famous figure in Tamil cinema, but also in other cultures and media. He has been portrayed in various books, comics, games, and movies. For example, he appears as a character in the manga and anime series Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas, where he is the master of the Gold Saint Dohko. He also appears in the video game series Tekken, where he is the founder of the Mishima Zaibatsu and the ancestor of Heihachi Mishima.
 
Bodhidharma's life and teachings have inspired many people across the world. He is regarded as a symbol of wisdom, courage, and enlightenment. He is also revered as a patron saint of martial arts, especially Shaolin Kung Fu. His legacy lives on in the hearts and minds of his followers and admirers.
  
One of the most intriguing aspects of Bodhidharma's story is the mystery surrounding his death. According to some legends, he died at the age of 150 in China, and his body was buried in a tomb. However, some accounts claim that he returned to India after his death, and his tomb was found empty. Some even say that he never died, but entered a state of deep meditation and became immortal.
 
Another fascinating aspect of Bodhidharma's story is the connection between him and the mythical figure of Kalki, the tenth and final avatar of Vishnu in Hinduism. Some scholars have suggested that Bodhidharma was an incarnation of Kalki, who was prophesied to appear at the end of the Kali Yuga, the current age of darkness and corruption. According to this theory, Bodhidharma's mission was to restore the balance of dharma (righteousness) in the world by spreading Buddhism and martial arts.
 
Whether you believe in these legends or not, there is no doubt that Bodhidharma was a remarkable person who left a lasting impact on history and culture. He was a pioneer of Zen Buddhism and a master of martial arts. He was a hero and a legend. He was Bodhidharma.
