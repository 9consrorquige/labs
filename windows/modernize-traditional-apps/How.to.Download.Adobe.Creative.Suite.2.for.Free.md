# How to Download Adobe Creative Suite 2 for Free
 
Adobe Creative Suite 2 (CS2) is a collection of software applications for graphic design, video editing, and web development that was released in 2005. Adobe discontinued the support and activation servers for CS2 in 2013, and made the software available for free download on their website. However, this offer was intended only for existing customers who legally purchased a license for CS2, and not for new users. Adobe has since removed the download links from their website, but you can still find them on some third-party sites.
