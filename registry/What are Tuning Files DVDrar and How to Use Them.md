# What are Tuning Files DVD.rar and How to Use Them?
 
Tuning files DVD.rar is a compressed archive file that contains more than 20,000 tuned files for most ECU cars. ECU stands for Engine Control Unit, which is the computer that controls the engine performance and emissions. Tuned files are modified versions of the original ECU software that can improve the power, torque, fuel efficiency, or responsiveness of the engine.

To use tuning files DVD.rar, you need to extract the contents of the archive using a software like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You will get a folder with many subfolders containing different types of tuning files for various car models and ECU types. You also need a device that can read and write ECU data, such as an OBD scanner or a flasher tool. You need to connect the device to your car's diagnostic port and select the appropriate tuning file for your ECU. Then you need to upload the tuning file to your ECU and wait for the process to complete. After that, you can enjoy the improved performance of your car.
 
However, before you use tuning files DVD.rar, you should be aware of some risks and limitations. Tuning files are not official or authorized by the car manufacturers or ECU suppliers. They may not be compatible with your car's specifications or emission standards. They may also cause damage to your engine or other components if they are not properly calibrated or tested. Tuning files may also void your car's warranty or insurance coverage. Therefore, you should use tuning files DVD.rar at your own risk and responsibility.
  
## Benefits and Drawbacks of Tuning Files
 
Tuning files are not only for ECU tuning, but also for gearbox tuning. Gearbox tuning can improve both comfort and performance in different driving conditions and for different kinds of gearboxes. However, gearbox tuning also has some risks and limitations that you should be aware of before you decide to use tuning files DVD.rar for your gearbox.
 
Some of the benefits of gearbox tuning are:
 
- Adjusting torque limits: When you tune your engine, measurements of torque at Canbus can be too high for the stock setup. This is why the computer can limit torque and thus reduce or even negate the benefits of tuning. We can increase the torque limits in the gearbox and thus send more power to the wheels.
- Adjustment in shift points: You can change the shift points in Drive and/or ECO modes for both upshifts and downshifts to suit your driving style and preferences. You can also make the shifts faster or smoother depending on your needs.
- Launch Control Activation and/or Adjustment: You can activate or adjust the launch control feature to get the best possible acceleration from a standstill. This can be useful for racing or drag events.
- Adjustment in Clamping Pressure: You can increase the clamping pressure to make the shifts more responsive and firm. This can also reduce clutch wear and slippage.
- Adjustment in Torque Converter Locking Feature: You can adjust the timing and manner of locking the torque converter to optimize the balance between comfort and efficiency. You can also disable the locking feature if you want to have more fluidity in gear changes.
- Adjustment in RPM Limits: You can raise or lower the RPM limits to prevent over-revving or under-revving your engine. This can also affect the fuel consumption and emissions.

Some of the drawbacks of gearbox tuning are:

- Possible damage to gearbox components: If you tune your gearbox too aggressively or without proper testing, you may cause damage to your gearbox components such as clutches, gears, valves, solenoids, etc. This may result in expensive repairs or replacements.
- Possible loss of warranty or insurance coverage: If you tune your gearbox, you may void your warranty or insurance coverage from your car manufacturer or provider. This means that you may not be able to claim any compensation or assistance if something goes wrong with your gearbox or other parts of your car.
- Possible legal issues: If you tune your gearbox, you may violate some legal regulations or standards regarding emissions, noise, safety, etc. This may result in fines, penalties, or even legal actions against you.

Therefore, before you use tuning files DVD.rar for your gearbox, you should weigh the pros and cons carefully and consult with a professional tuner who can advise you on the best options for your car and your goals.
