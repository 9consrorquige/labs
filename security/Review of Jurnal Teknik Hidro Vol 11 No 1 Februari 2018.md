The first article discusses the characteristics of flow on ogee spillways, which are commonly used to control water discharge from dams or reservoirs. The authors conducted an experimental study in the hydraulic laboratory of Universitas Muslim Indonesia using a current meter and a measuring bar to measure the flow velocity, depth, and specific energy at different sections of the spillway. The results showed that the ogee spillway can transform supercritical flow into critical and subcritical flow in the downstream section, and that the specific energy depends on the water level.
 
The second, third, and fourth articles analyze the behavior of water flow in open channels with different cross-sectional shapes: rectangular, triangular, and trapezoidal. The authors used the continuity equation, the energy equation, and the Manning equation to derive the expressions for flow velocity, depth, discharge, specific energy, critical depth, and critical slope for each shape. The authors also presented graphs and tables to compare the flow characteristics among different shapes under various conditions.
 
The journal provides useful information and insights for students and researchers who are interested in hydraulics and water resources engineering. The journal is available online at [https://journal.unismuh.ac.id/index.php/hidro/article/download/2441/1930](https://journal.unismuh.ac.id/index.php/hidro/article/download/2441/1930).
  
The journal also contains a foreword by the editor, Dr. Muh. Ilham Nur, who explains the background and objectives of the journal. He states that the journal aims to disseminate the results of research and development in the field of hydraulics and water resources engineering, as well as to provide a forum for discussion and exchange of ideas among academics, practitioners, and policy makers. He also expresses his gratitude to the authors, reviewers, and editorial board for their contributions and support.
 
The journal follows a standard format and style for scientific publications. Each article has an abstract, an introduction, a literature review, a methodology, a result and discussion, a conclusion, and a reference list. The articles are written in Indonesian with English abstracts and keywords. The journal uses the APA citation style and provides the DOI for each article. The journal also has an ISSN number for both online and print versions.
 
The journal is one of the publications of the Faculty of Engineering of Universitas Muhammadiyah Makassar, which is one of the leading universities in Indonesia. The university was established in 1963 and has 11 faculties and 36 study programs. The university is committed to developing academic excellence, research innovation, and social service based on Islamic values.
